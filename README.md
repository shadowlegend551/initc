This projects purpose is to make setting up projects easier. With one command you can make an entire project's structure.
Usage: `initc <project-root-path> <language-name>`

If your preferred language is not found by initc, you can add it yourself to `~/.local/share/initc/custom`. Just make a basic project template in the language to a folder with the language as its name and mv it to `custom`.

Currently supported languages (`language-name` in parenthesis):
- C (c)
